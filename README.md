# BinOpLeR
This repository contains test results of our paper "BinOpLeR: Optimization Level Recovery from Binaries based on Rich Semantic Instruction Image and Weighted Voting".
# Contents
ResultsFromFuncModel_Arm.zip is the detection results from the function optimization level detection model for ARM architecture, with the RSII as input.

ResultsFromFuncModel_Mips.zip is the detection results from the function optimization level detection model for MIPS architecture, with the RSII as input.

BinaryDetectionResult_withLenProFixLen_Arm.zip is the reference results through the weighted voiting scheme based on the detection results of ResultsFromFuncModel_Arm.zip.

BinaryDetectionResult_withLenProFixLen_Mips.zip is the reference results through the weighted voiting scheme based on the detection results of ResultsFromFuncModel_Mips.zip.

coreutils-9.1-arm* and coreutils-9.1-mips* are the gray images generated from RSII generator. We only uploaded a portion of the test images due to spatial constraints.
